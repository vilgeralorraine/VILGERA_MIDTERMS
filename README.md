# What is React.js?
React.js is an open-source JavaScript package designed with precision by Facebook to simplify the complex process of creating interactive user interfaces. Consider a user interface designed using React as a collection of components, each responsible for producing a small, reusable piece of HTML code.

### How to Set Up React  for Future Projects

#### Step 1: Install Node.js
Because React.js is a JavaScript library, you must first install Node.js, which is a JavaScript runtime environment that enables you to run JavaScript on the server. So, when you write React, you add JavaScript functions in your project, and Node.js runs this JavaScript code on the web page.

> - Visit the <https://nodejs.org/en/> website. On their website, you can download either the suggested or the current version.<br>
> - Install the Node.js version of your choice on your computer.<br>
> - When the installation is complete, open your command prompt to confirm that Node was successfully installed. In your command prompt, type **node -v** and press Enter. This command should show the current Node version installed on your PC.<br>

#### Step 2: Install React
Use create-react-app (CRA) to install React.

> - Still in the command prompt window, navigate to the directory where you want to create your React project. To do this, type **cd [directory name]** and press Enter.<br>
